TipCalculator.
This App is the challenge from Frontendmentor.io. As I didn't have original project designs, my challenge was to build out this calculator and get it looking as close to the original design. 
I used HTML, CSS, and JS Vanilla to complete this challenge.
The users of this App can:
- see an optimal layout of the App depending on their device's screen size;
- see all hover states for all interactive elements;
- calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person.
